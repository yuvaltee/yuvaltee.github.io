            This is a virtual 2 player ping pong game that I made for my fall final in 2022. 
            <br>
            It allows you to use either arrows or letters to move your paddle and block the ball coming towards you!
            <br>
            The purpose of this game is to easily play your friends in ping pong!

            This is my ice cream shop simulator. The player is represented as a customer beinng 
            <br>
            asked questions about the menu. Once you have placed your order, a reciept is returned.

            The prupose of this code is to help food service shops to take orders faster.
